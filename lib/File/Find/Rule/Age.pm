=head1 NAME

File::Find::Rule::Age - rule to match on file age

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Legacy API
    use File::Find::Rule::Age;
    my @old_files = find( file   => age => [ older => '1M' ], in => '.' );
    my @today     = find( exists => age => [ newer => '1D' ], in => '.' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

File::Find::Rule::Age makes it easy to search for files based on their age.
DateTime and File::stat are used to do the behind the scenes work, with
File::Find::Rule doing the Heavy Lifting.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 Legacy Interface

    age( [ $criterion => $age ] )

=over 4

=item $criterion

must be one of "older" or "newer", respectively.

=item $age

must match /^(\d+)([DWMYhms])$/ where D, W, M, Y, h, m and s are "day(s)",
"week(s)", "month(s)", "year(s)", "hour(s)", "minute(s)"  and "second(s)",
respectively - I bet you weren't expecting that.

The given interval is subtracted from C<now> for every file which is checked
to ensure search rules instantiated once and executed several times in
process lifetime.

=back

By 'age' I mean 'time elapsed after mtime' (the last time the file was
modified) - without the equal timestamp.

    # now is 2014-05-01T00:00:00, start of this years workers day
    # let's see what has been worked last week
    my @old_files = find( file => age => [ older => "1W" ], in => $ENV{HOME} );
    # @old_files will now contain all files changed 2014-04-24T00:00:01 or later,
    # 2014-04-24T00:00:00 is ignored

=head2 Modern API

The modern API provides 12 functions to match timestamps:

             | before  | until    | since    | after
   ----------+---------+----------+----------+---------
    modfied  | mtime < | mtime <= | mtime >= | mtime >
   ----------+---------+----------+----------+---------
    accessed | atime < | atime <= | atime >= | atime >
   ----------+---------+----------+----------+---------
    created  | ctime < | ctime <= | ctime >= | ctime >
   ----------+---------+----------+----------+---------

Each function takes one argument - the referring timestamp. Following
representations are supported (in order of check):

=over 4

=item File name

The corresponding C<mtime>, C<atime> or C<ctime> or the specified file is
used to do the appropriate equation, respectively.

If a relative path name is specified and the current working directory is
changed since rule instantiation, the result is undefined.

=item seconds since epoch

Each's file C<mtime>, C<atime> or C<ctime> is compared as requested to
given number.

=item DateTime object

Each's file C<mtime>, C<atime> or C<ctime> is compared as requested to
given DateTime.

=item DateTime::Duration object

Each's file C<mtime>, C<atime> or C<ctime> is compared as requested to
given C<< now - $duration >>. C<now> is determined at each check again,
for same reasons as in legacy API.

=back

=head3 Examples

    use File::Find::Rule;
    use File::Fine::Rule::Age;

    my $today = DateTime->now->truncate( to => "today" );
    my @today = find( owned => modified_since => $today, in => $ENV{PROJECT_ROOT} );

    my @updated = find( file => mofified_after => $self->get_cache_timestamp,
                        in => $self->inbox );
